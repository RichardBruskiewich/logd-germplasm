**Project goal statement**: To facilitate the integration of large amounts of germplasm-related data, such as collection information, field trials data and DNA sequences, by connecting these disparate data sources together.

**Length of project**: 12 months.

|Activity|Time Frame|Anticipated Outputs|
|:-------|:---------|:------------------|
| Survey publicly available data sets about germplasm | 12 months | At least 5 datasets about germplasm identified and downloaded |
| Explore how the data sets could be linked together | 4 months | VoID description of the possible interlinks is developed |
|Explore interesting questions that could be answered if the data sets are linked| 3 months | Wiki page of at least 20 important scientific questions is created |
|Convert data sets to RDF using common vocabularies| 12 months| All relevant datasets are converted into the same format  |
|Build links using link-discovery software| 12 months | All the interlinks are described in RDF |
|Write SPARQL queries for each of the questions identified in the earlier activity| 2 months |  SPARQL queries that answer the 20 questions are written |
|Create user interface displaying all the interconnected data| 3 months | Simple user interface on the Web is created |
|Publish best-practices on how to reference germplasm accessions using RDF| 3 months |  Document on how to make explicit links to germplasm resources is produced |
|Write paper about project| 1 month  | Paper about project is published to a Bioinformatics or Semantic Web journal|
